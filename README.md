# Multiplayer Concurrency

This project served as a senior project in the UT Martin computer science program.

The objective of the project was to create a custom peer-to-peer networked multiplayer space shooter game in the Unity engine.

This end result is able to handle up to four concurrent players in the same game instance.

Due to time constraints, it is highly possible for players to get out of sync with one another as the game progresses.
